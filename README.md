Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

# the goal of this lab is to learn about how logic gates can be applied to computer science

Hexadecimal color representation
Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/

# In a RGB color space, hex #ab00ff is composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 280.2 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 50%. #ab00ff color hex could be obtained by blending #ff00ff with #5700ff. Closest websafe color is: #9900ff.

When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.

# yes because websites don't really use bright colors like this it would make it painful to the eyes to see it. Unless it is used for small banners, then it wouldn't be much of a problem.

Logic Gates and circuits
Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.

# a truth table represents the inputs and output of a logic gate. It creates a simple way of understanding how logic gates work.

How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?

# a NAND gate is like the NOT gate and the AND gate applied to one gate.

IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design

# it helps people understand the grave consequences when you have faulty reasoning and it gives reason to engineers to do their work 

Conclusion

# i learned how logic gates work and how they make up computer chips and how they are used in binary code
